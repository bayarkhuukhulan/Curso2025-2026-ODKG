Consequently the course will start with the analysis of data sources in an organization and very briefly analyzed data base management systems. Emphasis will be put on the ethical aspects regarding data management and knowledge extraction. Later students will understand the data value chain and will go deep into the process of knowledge extraction. At this stage CRISP-Dm methodology will be used. The course will follow on the different phases of the process: i) business understanding, ii) data understanding, iii) data preparation, iv) modeling v) evaluation and vi) deployment. Through all the phases the main emphasis will be on students getting hands on the different steps, techniques, algorithms and tools."

Students will explore how machines can generate text, images, and other forms of media by leveraging powerful deep learning architectures. Generative AI refers to AI systems capable of producing novel content based on human input - commonly called prompts. Language models, particularly large-scale models like the GPT series lie at the heart of these systems. They not only process and generate human language but can also serve as a foundation for multimodal applications that integrate text, images, and audio. These technologies are evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly accessible through websites, APIs, and opensource tools. As a result, their influence is spreading across many sectors. They are transforming creative industries, enhancing education, and driving innovation in fields such as scientific research, healthcare, and more. The course explores both the theoretical foundations and practical techniques needed to build generative AI solutions."
